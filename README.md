# Discord Guild Chat for Darkages

This project can help setup a bidirectional guild chat in a discord server.

##### What does that mean?

It means any guild chat messages in Darkages show up in a discord channel, and any messages in that discord channel show up in-game.

### Setup:

## TODO:
- ~~convert to Typescript~~
- linting / simple tests
- update README and setup instructions
- ~~support sending large messages as multiple in-game chats~~
- swap messenger Aisling
